Sprint 1 Baby Project Report
	The available accounts for the policy holders are Fixed, FixedLT, 1YrA, 1YrD, 1YrF, and Var. All 3 are allocated 100% in Vanguard. The table representations of the data can be seen in the code file.
	
The Json file with illustration ID: 0a58ef5a-9f01-49bc-9bb7-f13ab042b80f has the following Riders:
•	Conversion Rider (Automatic): provided at no additional cost, this allows policy holders to change policies during the 8th policy year without facing Surrender fees.
•	Minimum Indexed Benefit Rider (Automatic): included at no additional cost, it may provide an Indexed Termination Credit (ITC) when Segment Indexed Interest is less than the sum of the Indexed Fixed Option Charges. ITC adds to the Net Cash Surrender Value, can impact the Death Benefit, and can impact whether or not a policy lapses and the amount of payment due during a grace period.
•	Overloan Protection 3 Rider (Automatic): When exercised, it guarantees the policy will not lapse. Includes a one-time rider charge when exercised.
•	Accelerated Death Benefit Rider for Chronic and Terminal Illness (Premier Living Benefits Rider 2) (Optional)
•	No Lapse Guarantee Rider (Short-Term No Lapse Guarantee) (Automatic): In effect as long as minimum premium is paid, this guarantees Death Benefit for the duration of the STNLG,
•	Accelerated Death Benefit Rider for Terminal Illness (Terminal Illness Rider) (Optional): Those with a life expectancy of 12 months or less can access benefits early. There is no upfront cost, but the death benefit is decreased by more than the amount paid out. It is added to the policy unless a policyholder specifically declines.
